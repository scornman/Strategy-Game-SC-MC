- If a red piece moves into a location containing a blue piece of lower rank, the moveResult's battleWinner contains the red piece and the former location of the blue piece. The blue piece is removed from the board.
- If a red piece moves into a location containing a blue piece of higher rank, the moveResult's battleWinner 
	contains the blue piece and the former location of the red piece. The red piece is removed from the board.
- After 12 moves have been made in a game (6 for each player), the final move should result in a DRAW.

- If a red piece moves into a location containing a blue piece of the same rank, the moveResult's battleWinner is null.
- After the factory method creates a controller with a given configuration, getPieceAt() for one of the given 	locations should return the corresponding piece in the configuration.
- StrategyGameFactory.makeBetaStrategyGame throws a StrategyException if either starting configuration is null.
- StrategyGameFactory.makeAlphaStragegyGame actually works.
- After the factory method creates a controller with a given configuration, getPieceAt() for one of the 
	given locations should return the corresponding piece in the configuration.
-Throw Exception if move() and not +1y -1y +1x or -1x
-If red Marshal attacks blue Lt. MoveResultStatus(OK)
	& getBattleWinner() "on the move result" == Marshal [PieceLocationDescriptor]
*keep whos turn it is (RED initially)
